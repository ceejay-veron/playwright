How to use Trace Viewer
1. open config file and set trace: 'on-first-retry'
'on-first-retry' - Record a trace only when retrying a test for the first time.
'off' -Do not record a trace
'on' - Record a trace for each test. (not recommended as it's performance heavy)
'retain-on-failure' - Record a trace for each test, but remove it from successful test runs
2. set retries
3. check trace.zip file created under test-results folder
4. or -view trace -npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
or npx playwright show-trace  ./test-results/my_first_test.spec.js/trace.zip  
5. or go to trace.playwright.dev


HOw to set trace programmatically
Set Context in BDD
1.start Tracing

 await context.tracing.start (
{
snapshots: true,
screenshots: true

});

2. stop tracing

await context.tracing.stop({path: 'test1_trace.zip'})



NOT TO GET NO TEST FOUND

1. set up your own test match regex in the playwright test config.
By default, Playwright Test looks for files matching .*(test|spec)\.(js|ts|mjs), but you can run any js file by doing this:


import { PlaywrightTestConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  testMatch: /.*.js/,
};
export default config;

2. Test should be in e2e folder

3. use forward slashes after launching terminal from vscode on windows laptop and it worked. npx playwright test ./tests/example.spec.js
